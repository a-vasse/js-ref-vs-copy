    console.log(players, team); //note: updating the copy will update the original

    // we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy.
    //They both point to the same array!

    // How to REALLY copy an array, and not just reference it
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[0] = 'Alex'
    console.log(players, team2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[0] = 'Reina'
    console.log(players, team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[0] = 'Tofu';
    console.log(players, team4);


    // The same thing goes for objects. Using equals only references directly.

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'The Person',
      age: 80
    };

    const mans = person

    mans.age = 3
    console.log(person) // person.age = 3

    //How to copy an object:
    let next_mans = Object.assign({}, person);
    console.log(next_mans);

    next_mans.name = "The Mans"
    console.log(next_mans); //now name is "The Mans"

    //copy and add/change details
    next_mans = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(next_mans); //{name: 'The Person', age: 12, number: 99}
    //note, new arguements are added, current arguements with new values are changed
